Q4,00:03.2,Stoppage: Inadvertent Whistle,Buddy Hield,Jaylen Brown,CNC,"On replay review, the coach's challenge of the shooting foul called on Hield (IND) was deemed successful.

While in contact with the ball, Hield also makes minimal contact with Brown's head, and on review that contact was correctly deemed incidental.  As the rulebook makes clear, the mere fact that contact occurs does not necessarily constitute a foul; contact which is incidental to an effort by a player to defend an opponent, reach a loose ball, or perform normal defensive or offensive movements is not considered illegal.  Play resumed with IND possession, since Nesmith (IND) had imminent possession at the point of interruption.",00:12.8       To       00:03.2,gameId=0022300507,Celtics(131) @ Pacers(133),"January 08, 2024",2024-01-18T04:03:28Z

Referees conducted a replay review to determine if the foul was called with no time remaining on the clock (00:00), and determined it was called before the expiration of time.
