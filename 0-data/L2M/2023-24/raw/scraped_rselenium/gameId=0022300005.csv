Q4,00:01.9,Turnover: Offensive Goaltending,Draymond Green,Thunder,CNC,"After communicating with the Replay Center, the ruling on the floor of offensive basket interference is overturned. There is clear and conclusive evidence that Green (GSW) does not touch the ball and -- although Green makes contact with the rim -- contacting the rim, standing alone, does not violate the rule.  In order for contact with the rim to constitute offensive basket interference when the ball is not in the net, it must (a) occur while the ball is sitting or rolling on the rim and using the rim as its lower base, (b) cause the ball to take an unnatural bounce, or (c) move the rim off-center.  None of those conditions were satisfied on this play, so there was no basket interference.",00:20.9       To       00:00.0,gameId=0022300005,Warriors(141) @ Thunder(139),"November 03, 2023",2023-11-06T15:33:49Z
